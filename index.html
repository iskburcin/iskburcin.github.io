          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Burçin, a Computer Engineering student with a deep passion for
            technology, learning, and exploring new things. I believe that
            curiosity and persistence are the keys to growth, and I strive to
            keep learning every day. I enjoy coding, problem-solving, and diving
            into new programming languages and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside my academic journey, I'm on an Erasmus adventure in Opole,
            Poland, which has broadened my horizons both academically and
            personally. When I'm not immersed in tech, I love to travel, read,
            and explore different cultures. My goal is to become a developer and
            contribute to the world of machine learning and AI while continually
            improving myself in every area of life.

          <h2>Tech - My Code Snippets</h2>
          <p>
            This is where I compile the coding snippets I've encountered during
            my learning process. These are pieces of code I don't want to
            forget, and I think they could be helpful to others too. Whether
            it's a clever CSS trick, a useful Python function, or an innovative
            Flutter solution, you'll find a variety of code samples that have
            helped me on my journey. I encourage you to explore and learn from
            these snippets as they represent the small yet impactful milestones
            in my development process.

          <h2>My World - Traveling & Memories</h2>
          <p>
            As a child, I always dreamed of traveling the world. Now, with the
            incredible opportunity of Erasmus, I'm starting to make those dreams
            a reality! I’ve begun my journey by coloring my map with places I’ve
            visited. The colored spots represent the destinations I’ve explored,
            and each place holds unique memories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to click on <strong>My Memories</strong> to see the
            stories and experiences I’ve collected along the way. In
            <strong>My Routes</strong>, you can find the pinned locations of
            these places on Google Maps, so you can follow my travels in more
            detail.
