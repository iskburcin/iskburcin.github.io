            <p>
              A 22-year-old Computer Engineering student at Alanya University,
              currently on an Erasmus exchange at Politechnica Opoliska for the
              winter semester. Iâ€™m passionate about coding, solving problems,
              and constantly learning new things. In my free time, you can find
              me reading, listening to music, traveling (although Iâ€™ve been
              questioning it lately ðŸ˜Š), cooking, sleeping, or just
              experimenting with new coding projects.

              Though Iâ€™m not a very social person, Iâ€™ve learned it when i was a child i think. And, i like being alone, silence, calm.

          <h2>My Journey in Tech - How I Started</h2>
          <p>
            I was initially introduced to the world of coding in university,
            where I learned theoretical knowledge. But it wasnâ€™t until I had my
            first real-world internship at BRM Software that I realized the
            power of coding to create actual projects. That was the moment I
            understood that I could build something tangible, and this
            experience motivated me to start developing apps on my own. My
            journey from theory to practice has been incredibly rewarding, and I
            continue to grow my skill set every day!

              <p>
                This project came from a personal need. Since I'm not from a
                wealthy family, I needed a way to keep track of all the
                currencies I had while on Erasmus. This app helps me track my
                expenses, so I can see how much I should spend daily, weekly,
                and monthly.

        <h2>The Future - What's Next for Me?</h2>
        <p>
          The journey has just begun! Iâ€™m eager to explore more advanced technologies and build projects that can make a difference. My goal is to continue developing my skills in AI, Flutter, and web development, and eventually contribute to projects that solve real-world problems. As I continue my Erasmus journey and beyond, I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
